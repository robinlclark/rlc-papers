>>This paper uses a combination of game theory (in particular, Crawford and Sobel's (1981) work on signaling games) and corpus data to work out a model of the change in the interpretation of negativr elements observed in many languages.

###Game theory and meaning

> - Robin Clark. 2016. "Games, Meaning, and Linguistic Signaling". ms. University of Pennsylvania

>
>>A short paper on using games of incomplete information to analyze speech acts and focal points.  This manuscript is to be expanded to include Bayesian updating!

> - Christopher Ahern, Robin Clark, and Steven O. Kimbrough. 2014. "Extended Abstract: Coordination without Association". ms, University of Pennsylvania.

>>>[cooperationwithoutAssociation.pdf](https://github.com/robinlclark/rlc-papers/blob/master/cooperationwithoutAssociation.pdf)

>>Cooperation is usually said to evolve from repeated plays, but this involves a reliable association between players.  In this version, players might play one-shot, but are given (some) information about the average return of (a subset of) other palyers.  They all strive to be above average in their earnings; if they earn below average, they adjust their play, with the result that a certain level of cooperation is always reliably present and could act as a ratchet for the evolution of cooperation.

> - Robin Clark. 2012. "Social and Physical Coordination". <i>Interaction Studies</i>. 13(1). 66-79.
>
>>>[socialandPhysicalCoordination.pdf](https://github.com/robinlclark/rlc-papers/blob/master/socialandPhysicalCoordination.pdf)
>
>>As the title suggests, a short survey on connections between social coordination (groups of people coordinating their behavior) and physical coordination (how we, for example, coordinate body movements).

> - Robin Clark and Prashant Parikh. 2007. "Game Theory and Discourse Anaphora". <i>Journal of Logic, Language and Information</i>, 16, 265-282.

>>>[gameTheoryandDiscourseAnaphora.pdf](https://github.com/robinlclark/rlc-papers/blob/master/gameTheoryandDiscourseAnaphora.pdf)
>
>>This is a model of reference tracking using game theoretic contructs.  I think I would more carefully incorporate focal points and updating; some of this was done in <i>Meaningful Games</i> (2012; The MIT Press).

> - Laia Mayol and Robin Clark. 2010. "Pronouns in Catalan: Games of partial information and the use of linguistic resources." <i>Journal of Pragmatics</i>. 42. 781-799.

>>This paper uses the framework of Clark and Parikh (2007) to look at Catalan; interesting because Catalan has null pronouns.  In other words, Catalan has a resource that English lacks and is able to distribute its resources differently!

###Neuroscience: Quantifiers, Number Sense and Strategic Reasoning

> - Robin Clark. 2011. "Generalized quantifiers and number sense". <i>Philosophy Compass</i>. 6/9. 611-621.

>>Cooperation is usually said to evolve from repeated plays, but this involves a reliable association between players.  In this version, players might play one-shot, but are given (some) information about the average return of (a subset of) other palyers.  They all strive to be above average in their earnings; if they earn below average, they adjust their play, with the result that a certain level of cooperation is always reliably present and could act as a ratchet for the evolution of cooperation.

>>This paper uses the framework of Clark and Parikh (2007) to look at Catalan; interesting because Catalan has null pronouns.  In other words, Catalan has a resource that English lacks and is able to distribute its resources differently!

>>Some extent of ambiguity is ubiquitous in everyday conversations. For example, words have multiple meaning and very common pronouns, like “he” and “she” (anaphoric pronouns), have little meaning on their own and refer to a noun that has been previously introduced in the discourse. Ambiguity triggers a decision process that is not a subroutine of language processing but rather a more general domain resource. Therefore non-aphasic patients with limited decision-making capability can encounter severe limitation in language processing due to extra linguistic limitations. In the present study, we test patients with behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD), focusing on anaphora as a paradigmatic example of ambiguity resolution in the linguistic domain.

>>We consider connections between number sense—the ability to judge number—and the inter- pretation of natural language quantifiers. In particular, we present empirical evidence concerning the neuro- anatomical underpinnings of number sense and quan- tifier interpretation. We show, further, that impairment of number sense in patients can result in the impair- ment of the ability to interpret sentences containing quantifiers. This result demonstrates that number sense supports some aspects of the language faculty.

>>In this study, we investigated patients with focal neurodegenerative diseases to examine a formal linguistic distinction between classes of generalized quantifiers, like “some X” and “less than half of X.” Our model of quantifier comprehension proposes that number knowledge is required to understand both first-order and higher-order quantifiers. The present results demonstrate that corticobasal degeneration (CBD) patients, who have number knowledge impairments but little evidence for a deficit understanding other aspects of language, are impaired in their comprehension of quantiWers relative to healthy seniors, Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients [F(3, 77) D 4.98; p < .005]. Moreover, our model attempts to honor a distinction in complexity between classes of quantifiers such that working memory is required to comprehend higher-order quantifiers. Our results support this distinction by demonstrating that FTD and AD patients, who have working memory limitations, have greater difficulty understanding higher-order quantifiers relative to first-order quantiWers [F(1, 77) D 124.29; p < .001]. An important implication of these findings is that the meaning of generalized quantifiers appears to involve two dissociable components, number knowledge and working memory, which are supported by distinct brain regions.
